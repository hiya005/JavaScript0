# Class Notes

## 12.1.26

### Hoisting

1. The variable declaration and Function declaration will move to top of the scope.
2. Hoisting Will Perform Only in Var variable , not in let and const
 (no initialization, as let and const are of BLOCK scope).

#### WHY?

Js Is synchronous that is line by line - like interpreter 
but when line by line code reaches in JS engine it is stored in a place caled "CALLED STACK", then is processed altogether that is like a COMPILER , and in such instance var goes to top of the scope.

## 14.0.26

In for Loop do not use VAR , use let variable instantiatoin ONLY.
